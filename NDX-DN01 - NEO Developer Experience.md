# NDX-DN01 - NEO Developer Experience

- Author: Harry Pierson (harrypierson@ngd.neo.org)
- Status: Draft

## Abstract

This design note describes the goals and guiding principles of a world-class
experience for developers targeting the NEO platform. This note is intended to
be high level and aspirational. Further design notes will specify in detail how
individual capabilities will be implemented.

Note, design notes related to the NEO Developer Experience will be prefixed with
"NDX". For example, this design note is designated "NDX-DN01" to indicate "NEO
Developer Experience Design Note #1".

## Overview

> "Make the impossible possible, the possible easy, the easy elegant." - Mosh√© Feldenkrais

Broad adoption is critical for the NEO platform to deliver on the
[Smart Economy vision](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/whitepaper.html#neo-design-goals-smart-economy)
outlined in the [NEO white paper](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/whitepaper.html).
As the tech industry has seen play out many times, developers are critical to platform
adoption.

Developers desire two - somewhat contradictory - things: Capability and Simplicity.

Capability in this context means the raw capabilities of the underlying NEO platform.
Today, NEO provides capabilities for the decentralized management of programmable
digital assets via blockchain and smart contract technology. These capabilities
provide a trusted, intermediary-free technology solution for problems that have
traditionally required a trusted central authority to solve. Further capabilities
for the NEO platform include digital identity, decentralized file/data storage and
a blockchain oracle for access to data from outside the blockchain. Generally
speaking, the more capabilities provided by the core NEO platform, the more
powerful solutions developers can build.

On the other hand, developers want their jobs to be easy and the tools they use
to be simple. They want to be able to focus on the solution they are building, not
learning the platform they are building their solution on. Several of NEO's
technology choices are intended to simplify the experience for Smart Economy
developers building on the NEO platform. For example, by providing libraries and
Smart Contract compilers for multiple languages (C#, Java, Python and JavaScript
to name a few), the NEO platform enables developers to build Smart Contracts using
a language they already know instead of forcing them to learn something new.

While improving the core NEO platform capability is a critical task, this design
note and others that follow in the NDX series are focused on delivering a world-class
developer experience for the core NEO platform. As such, they will be primarily
focused on simplifying a Smart Economy developer's life rather than detailing new
capabilities of the core NEO platform itself.

## Developing for the Smart Economy

In order to specify the tools needed to provide a world-class developer experience,
it is first necessary to understand the architecture of a typical Smart Economy solution.
While Smart Economy is a large solution space with many possible technology approaches,
several key elements of architecture appear to be common across most solutions.

Programmable management of digital assets is a critical enabling feature of the
Smart Economy. The NEO white paper identifies blockchain technology with digital
identity and smart contracts as the critical platform pieces that the NEO platform
provides for Smart Economy applications.

### Blockchain Decentralized Application Architecture

At it's core, a blockchain is an open, decentralized, cryptographically secure
ledger of transactions. The blockchain runs on a disparate set of machines,
generating ledger entries known as "blocks" that are open for all to inspect and
are impossible to forge.

Nodes in the blockchain topology communicate using a full-duplex peer-to-peer
[network protocol](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/network/network-protocol.html)
running on top of TCP and/or WebSockets. This protocol drives the
[consensus algorithm](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/basic/consensus/whitepaper.html)
used to generate new blocks as well as to synchronize data between nodes in the
blockchain.

Nodes using the peer-to-peer protocol typically establish long-lived connections
to multiple other nodes in the network. These long-lived connections allow for
efficient communication between consensus nodes and they enable changes to the
system - for example, a new block being created - to be broadcast across the
entire network.

Nodes using this peer-to-peer protocol typically have a full copy of the
blockchain ledger locally on the node. The data generated by the blockchain is
non-trivial. As of July 7th, 2019, the 
[MainNet offline synchronization package](https://sync.ngd.network/)
is 5.36 gigabytes.

Between the connection-oriented network protocol and the need to store gigabytes
of blockchain data, it's reasonable to expect that most nodes in the blockchain
network would be dedicated, always-on, always-connected server class machines.
This implies that the blockchain must provide a mechanism for devices that are not
a part of blockchain network to interact with the blockchain without being always
connected or having a fully synchronized copy of the blockchain data.

The NEO blockchain provides such a mechanism. In addition to full-duplex TCP protocol
used for intra-node communication, the NEO blockchain provides a stateless,
request-response [remote API interface](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/cli/latest-version/api.html)
for accessing blockchain data from devices that aren't a part of the blockchain
network. this interface uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
running on top of HTTP or HTTPS.

Other blockchain ecosystems refer to devices accessing the network via a
remote API as "lite" nodes while devices in the blockchain network are "full"
nodes. However, this terminology is be somewhat confusing in the NEO ecosystem.
The [NEO Consensus white paper](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/basic/consensus/whitepaper.html)
divides so called "full" nodes between "ordinary" nodes and "consensus" nodes
(also in places called "bookkeeping" nodes). As such, this document proposes a
slightly different taxonomy:

- Code running on devices that is accessing the block chain network via the
  remote API interface will be referred to in this document as **off-chain**.
- Code running on devices that are connected to the block chain network via the
  full-duplex TCP protocol and have a full copy of the block chain data will be
  referred to in this document as **on-chain**.
  - Note, consensus nodes are considered part of the core blockchain infrastructure
    as they cannot be added to the NEO blockchain network independently. As such,
    consensus nodes do not run application specific code and are excluded from
    this taxonomy.
- Code running on block chain nodes as part of smart contracts will be referred
  to in this document as **in-chain**.

Decentralized blockchain applications typically have application code running in
at least two different locations. For example, a blockchain token would have
wallet code running on off-chain devices as well as smart contracts running
in-chain to manage the flow of tokens between users.

## Developer Scenarios

### Work with the developer ecosystem I already know

As per the official whitepaper, NEO is designed to integrate into existing
mainstream developer ecosystems. 

### Make it easy to get started

It must be easy for developers to aquire the t

Most language ecosystems have a package management system for 

* NPM for JavaScript
* NuGet for .NET
* VS Marketplace for Visual Studio Code


new project templates


### Have a tight developer inner loop

### A Blockchain optimized development and testing

Today, NEO provides two official clients to connect to a blockchain instance:
neo-cli and neo-gui. These clients can connect MainNet, TestNet or can
be used to run a private blockchain instance. These clients are used to
run consensus nodes and by real end users to transfer assets on the
MainNet. As such, they must be optimized for security and other
production usage scenarios.

NEO Express is a new NEO blockchain client, optimized for development
scenarios. It will be built on the same NEO platform core as neo-cli and
neo-gui are, ensuring that developer's code will run the same on MainNet
as it does in their development environment. NEO Express will run on the
developer's local machine, using as few resources as needed to host the
blockchain instance.

### Debug my smart contracts

### Manage My dApp for the Entire Application Lifecycle

Development doesn't end with deployment. In many ways, deploment represents the start of the real work

* deployment to mainnet 
* Monitoring a deployed dApps
* Associating events in remote clients, on chain clients and smart contracts
