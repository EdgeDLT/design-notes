# NDX-DN01 - NEO Developer Experience

- Author: Harry Pierson (harrypierson@ngd.neo.org)
- Status: Draft

## Abstract

This design note describes the goals and guiding principles of a world-class
experience for developers targeting the NEO platform. This note is intended to
be high level and aspirational. Further design notes will specify in detail how
individual capabilities will be implemented.

## Overview

> "Make the impossible possible, the possible easy, the easy elegant." - Mosh√© Feldenkrais

Broad adoption is critical for the NEO platform to deliver on the
[Smart Economy vision](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/whitepaper.html#neo-design-goals-smart-economy)
outlined in the [NEO Whitepaper](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/whitepaper.html).
As the tech industry has seen play out many times, developers are critical to platform
adoption.

Developers desire two - somewhat contradictory - things: Capability and Simplicity.

Capability in this context means the raw capabilities of the underlying NEO platform.
Today, NEO provides capabilities for the decentalized management of programmable
digital assets via blockchain and smart contract technology. These capabiliites
provide a trusted, intermediary-free technology solution for problems that have
traditionally required a trusted central authority to solve. Futher capabilities
for the NEO platform include digital idenity, decentralized file/data storage and
a blockchain oracle. Generally speaking, the more capabilities provided by the core
NEO platform, the more powerful solutions developers can build.

On the other hand, developers want their jobs to be easy and the tools they use
to be simple. They want to be able to focus on the solution they are building, not
learning the platform they are building their solution on. Several of NEO's
technology choices are intended to simplify the experience for Smart Economy
developers building on the NEO platform. For example, by providing libraries and
Smart Contract compilers for multiple languages (C#, Java, Python and JavaScript
to name a few), the NEO platform enables developers to build Smart Contracts using
a language they already know instead of forcing them to learn something new.

While improving the core NEO platform capability is a critical task, this Design
Note and others that follow in the series are focused on the NEO developer experience.
As such, they will be more focused on the simplicity side of the platform 

Note, Design Notes related to the NEO Developer Experience will be prefixed with
"NDX" (i.e. NEO Developer eXperience).


## Developing for the Smart Economy

Blockchain dApp Architecture

Management of digital assets is a critical enabling feature of the Smart Economy.
The NEO Whitepaper identifies blockchain technology as the critical infrastructure
needed to enable digital assets

The NEO blockchain is a peer-to-peer network topology running across a
decentralized networks of machines, 

The NEO blockchain utilizes two strategies for communication between nodes in
the network. 



The first strategy is a connection-oriented, full-duplex protocol running on top
of TCP and/or WebSockets.


https://docs.neo.org/en-us/network/network-protocol.html

 Nodes using this protocol typically
establish long-lived connections to multiple other nodes in the network. These
long-lived connections allow for efficient communication between consensus nodes
and they enable changes to the system - for example, a new block being created -
to be broadcast across the entire network. Nodes using this protocol typically have
a full copy of the blockchain data local to the node. 

The second strategy for communication within the blockchain network is a stateless,
request-response protocol. This protocol leverages [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
on top of HTTP. Unlike the

| RPC client / "lite" node | P2P Client / full node | smart contract |

Developing for the Smart Economy involves multiple different types of
projects.

- Decentralized Apps (also known as dApps) are apps that run across a
  peer-to-peer network of machines. There are many types of
  decentralized apps, but the primary focus of this design note is
  blockchain apps (as opposed to say BitTorrent apps).

- Smart Contracts are piec es of backend logic that are deployed into
  the blockchain. They can be invoked either by members of the
  blockchain network (perhaps proxying an invocation coming from
  outside the network), by other smart contracts or in response to
  pre-programmed condition in the blockchain itself.

## Scenarios

### Work with the developer ecosystem I already know

As per the official whitepaper, NEO is designed to integrate into existing
mainstream developer ecosystems. 

### Make it easy to get started

It must be easy for developers to aquire the t

Most language ecosystems have a package management system for 

* NPM for JavaScript
* NuGet for .NET
* VS Marketplace for Visual Studio Code


new project templates


### Have a tight developer inner loop

### A Blockchain optimized development and testing

Today, NEO provides two official clients to connect to a blockchain instance:
neo-cli and neo-gui. These clients can connect MainNet, TestNet or can
be used to run a private blockchain instance. These clients are used to
run consensus nodes and by real end users to transfer assets on the
MainNet. As such, they must be optimized for security and other
production usage scenarios.

NEO Express is a new NEO blockchain client, optimized for development
scenarios. It will be built on the same NEO platform core as neo-cli and
neo-gui are, ensuring that developer's code will run the same on MainNet
as it does in their development environment. NEO Express will run on the
developer's local machine, using as few resources as needed to host the
blockchain instance.

### Debug my smart contracts

### Manage My dApp for the Entire Application Lifecycle

Development doesn't end with deployment. In many ways, deploment represents the start of the real work

* deployment to mainnet 
* Monitoring a deployed dApps
* Associating events in remote clients, on chain clients and smart contracts
