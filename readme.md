# NEO Developer Experience Design Notes

This repository contains Design Notes describing developer tools for the
[NEO project](https://github.com/neo-project).

Design Notes is a process for making and disseminating architecturally
important design decisions. [NGD Seattle](https://github.com/ngdseattle)
is using this process to drive decisions across several projects related
to the NEO developer experience, including 
[NEO Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express) and the
[NEO Smart Contract Debugger for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-debugger).

The Design Note process was pioneered by
[Galen Hunt](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/galenh/)
on several projects at Microsoft and was released publicly as part of
[Microsoft's xlang project](http://github.com/Microsoft/xlang).

The Design Note process is described in
[DN00](DN00%20-%20The%20Design%20Note%20Processâ€‹.md). This document is
project independent by design. The remaining documents in this project
are specific to the NEO developer experience and are prefixed with "NDX".

* [NDX-DN01](NDX-DN01%20-%20NEO%20Developer%20Experience.md) describes
  the goals and guiding principles of a world-class experience for developers
  targeting the NEO platform.
* [NDX-DN02](NDX-DN02%20-%20NEO-FX%20Unified%20Programming%20Model.md) describes
  NEO's unified programming model.
* [NDX-DN03](NDX-DN03%20-%20NEO%20Express%20Development%20Blockchain.md) describes
  NEO Express, a NEO blockchain client application, optimized for development
  scenarios.
* [NDX-DN04](NDX-DN04%20-%20NEO%20Smart%20Contract%20Debugging.md) describes the
  NEO Smart Contract Debugger for Visual Studio Code.
* [NDX-DN05](NDX-DN05%20-%20NEO%20Toolkit%20for%20.NET.md) describes the libraries
  and tools used by .NET developers to target the NEO platform.

Additional Design Notes will be added in the future.
